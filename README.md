# Project Name

Chatbot project - pair programming.
To interact in chat using Js by adding variables, functions, eventlisternes, conditionals etc. 

## The problem

We shared our experiences.
Googled and looked into SO for other team mates questions and answers.
Got inspired by other chatbots.
We got the foundation and then built up the Js file step by step in order for both of us to follow the code.
Mostly we did the pair programming with live share and got an exceptional result.
If we had more time, we would have liked to sharpen up our Js knowledge.
